            <p>
                This dataset includes information on the internment camps. Not transcript, but within the source
                material are also further descriptions of the location and regime of the individual sites. Original
                documents now held at the Archives Nationales d'Outre Mer - Mairie d'Aix-en-Provence, were compiled
                on the 13th of April 1950.

            <h5 class="mb-4">Multiple datasets</h5>
            <p>
                Multiple datasets generated from the source material, including transcriptions of person entries
                (names, dates of birth and death where available, profession and often location, remarks and operating
                unit) and structured person instance data derived from them are provided. Key historic person instance
                information (appearances in documents), serialized as JSON according to a formal schema is available,
                together with the JSON Schema itself. This is intended for use by external applications, and can also
                be searched interactively using a DPCL presentation website (see below) which explains the datasets
                further. In contrast to transcription data, which represents the printed and hand-written source material,
                and is often organized inconsistently, the historic person instance data provided here enables reliable
                searching across multiple archival sources. The historic person instance JSON is lightweight to enable
                scalability across large numbers of sub-collections/archives: it does not contain all of the information
                sometimes transcribed, such as remarks and military operating unit. However it does provide IIIF canvas
                IDs, connecting the person instance to the page in the source document where it originally occurred.

            <h5 class="mb-4">Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) annotation collections</h5>
            <p>
                Where annotations can be generated from transcriptions they are provided as Web Annotation Data Model
                (WADM) annotation collections serialized as JSON, which are linked to source documents via PIDs. The
                annotation data can be used independently with the IIIF service provided here, to connect person instances
                interactively to their occurrence in the source documents. Provided principally for analysis preservation
                and verification purposes, the transcription data is less suitable for automated searching than the
                historic person instance JSON (above).
